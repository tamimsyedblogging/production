                            <p>This is an another lie or myth propagated by the media to isolate Muslims from Christians and create the fear among the Christians such that they don't gel with the Muslims neighbourhood. Islam is actually a Pro Christ. Islam
                                is the only non Christian faith which makes it an article of faith to believe in Jesus Christ(Peace be upon him). </p>
                            <p>I can’t even mention his name Jesus without suffixing it with "Peace be upon him". It is considered a sin in Islam. You won’t see media discussing on these topics and they always try to find people who speaks against Jesus(Peace
                                be upon him) and highlight those things in the media. </p>
                            <h2>Status of Jesus Christ(Peace be upon him) in Islam. </h2>
                            <p>Muslims believes Jesus Christ(Peace be upon him) was born miraculously without any male intervention to Maryam(Peace be upon her). This fact is even rejected by the modern day Christian society. Muslims believe he heals those
                                blind, lepers and deaf and dumb by Allah’s permission and Jesus Christ(Peace be upon him) brought dead to life by Allah’s permission. </p>
                            <p>Jesus Christ(Peace be upon him) is one of the Mightiest Messengers of Allah. We believe that Jesus Christ(Peace be upon him) is the Messiah, translated Christ. One may think, if Muslims and the Christians believe in Jesus Christ(Peace
                                be upon him) then where is &nbsp;the parting of the ways. </p>
                            <p>The parting of the ways happens when Christian believes Jesus Christ(Peace be upon him) as the son of Allah and we Muslims believe that Jesus Christ(Peace be upon him) is the Mightiest Messenger of Allah who was sent to the
                                Children of Israel to fulfill the law mentioned in the Torah which was given to Moses(Peace be upon him). </p>
                            <h2>Jesus Christ(Peace be upon him) in the Bible. </h2>
                            <p>In fact there is not a single unequivocal statement in the entire Bible where Jesus (Peace be upon him) himself says, "I am God" or where he says, "worship me". In fact the Bible contains statements attributed to Jesus (Peace
                                be upon him) in which he preached quite the contrary. The following statements in the Bible are attributed to Jesus Christ (Peace be upon him) </p>
                            <p>(i) "My Father is greater than I."[The Bible, John 14:28] </p>
                            <p>(ii) "My Father is greater than all."[The Bible, John 10:29] </p>
                            <p>(iii) "…I cast out devils by the Spirit of God…."[The Bible, Mathew 12:28] </p>
                            <p>(iv) "…I with the finger of God cast out devils…."[The Bible, Luke 11:20] </p>
                            <p>(v) "I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgement is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me."[The Bible, John 5:30] </p>
                            <h2>Jesus Christ(Peace be upon him) is not the son of Allah. </h2>
                            <p>We Muslims take this charge of Jesus Christ(Peace be upon him), the son of Allah pretty seriously as it is blasphemy against the Lord of the Worlds, Allah. Allah never beget nor begotten. </p>
                            <p>[Jesus] said, "Indeed, I am the servant of Allah . He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet.And He has made me blessed wherever I am and has enjoined upon me prayer and zakah as long as I remain alive. And [made
                                me] dutiful to my mother, and He has not made me a wretched tyrant. </p>
                            <p>And peace is on me the day I was born and the day I will die and the day I am raised alive.That is Jesus, the son of Mary - the word of truth about which they are in dispute.It is not [befitting] for Allah to take a son; exalted
                                is He! When He decrees an affair, He only says to it, "Be," and it is.[Jesus said], "And indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path.(Holy Quran 19:30,31,32,33,34,35,36) <a href="https://quran.com/19/30-36"

                            <p>And they say, "The Most Merciful has taken [for Himself] a son.You have done an atrocious thing.The heavens almost rupture therefrom and the earth splits open and the mountains collapse in devastation.That they attribute to
                                the Most Merciful a son.And it is not appropriate for the Most Merciful that He should take a son.There is no one in the heavens and earth but that he comes to the Most Merciful as a servant. Holy Quran 19:88-93 <a href="https://quran.com/19/88-93"

                            <p>And they say, "The Most Merciful has taken a son." Exalted is He! Rather, they are [but] honored servants.They cannot precede Him in word, and they act by His command. He knows what is [presently] before them and what will
                                be after them, and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom He approves. And they, from fear of Him, are apprehensive.And whoever of them should say, "Indeed, I am a god besides Him"- that one We would recompense
                                with Hell. Thus do We recompense the wrongdoers. https://quran.com/21/26-29 </p>
                            <h2>Status of Maryam(Peace be upon her) </h2>
                            <p>The status of Maryam(Peace be upon her) is so in Islam that she is the rank 1 woman according to Holy Quran as Holy Quran clearly states “”. There is even a chapter in Holy Quran called “Maryam(Chapter 19)” and you won’t find
                                such thing in Bible at all. </p>
                            <p>And [mention] when the angels said, "O Mary, indeed Allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the world's.O Mary, be devoutly obedient to your Lord and prostrate and bow with those who bow [in
                                prayer]." </p>
                            <p>That is from the news of the unseen which We reveal to you, [O Muhammad]. And you were not with them when they cast their pens as to which of them should be responsible for Mary. Nor were you with them when they disputed. </p>
                            <p>[And mention] when the angels said, "O Mary, indeed Allah gives you good tidings of a word from Him, whose name will be the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary - distinguished in this world and the Hereafter and among those brought
                                near [to Allah ]. </p>
                            <p>He will speak to the people in the cradle and in maturity and will be of the righteous."She said, "My Lord, how will I have a child when no man has touched me?" [The angel] said, "Such is Allah ; He creates what He wills. When
                                He decrees a matter, He only says to it, 'Be,' and it is. </p>
                            <p>And He will teach him writing and wisdom and the Torah and the GospelAnd [make him] a messenger to the Children of Israel, [who will say], 'Indeed I have come to you with a sign from your Lord in that I design for you from
                                clay [that which is] like the form of a bird, then I breathe into it and it becomes a bird by permission of Allah . </p>
                            <p>And I cure the blind and the leper, and I give life to the dead - by permission of Allah . And I inform you of what you eat and what you store in your houses. Indeed in that is a sign for you, if you are believers. Holy Quran
                                3:42-29 </p>
                            <p>As per the Holy Quran, Maryam(Peace be upon her) has been chosen as the woman of all nations. Even higher than the wives and daughters of Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon them all). </p>

                            <h2>Jesus Christ (Peace be upon him) will come back to defeat AntiChrist Dajjal. </h2>
                            <p>We Muslims believe that Jesus Christ(Peace be upon him) will come back to defeat Dajjal near to the Day of Judgement, the AntiChrist who would be ruling the world with oppression and tyranny and massacring innocent people for
                                not believing him as God. He would be ruling the entire world with the systematic oppression and everywhere will be bloodshed. </p>
                            <p>Jesus Christ(Peace be upon him) would come to this world and join the Muslim army who would be lead by the offspring of the Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him), Imam Mahdi(The Guide). The Muslim army at that time would be the
                                only power house on the face of the Earth who can put up a fight against the forces of the AntiChrist, Dajjal. </p>
                            <p>Jesus Christ(Peace be upon him) would eventually defeat the Dajjal and his forces and establish the true Islamic caliphate who would rule the world with justice, peace and harmony. Jesus Christ(Peace be upon him) would eventually
                                get married and have children and would die and would be buried near the grave of Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) in Madina. </p>
