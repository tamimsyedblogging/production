                            <h2><strong>Conversion to Atheism</strong></h2>
                            <div>
                                <p>Many Atheist before converting into Atheism were used to be believers in some faith but as they grow and based on social circumstances they stop believing in the religion of their father and their forefathers. Many after
                                    facing so many hardships in their life such as oppression in the society where one could have see people getting killed in the name of religion, caste or racism etc., and eventually realize that if there is god then
                                    there should be no violence and god would protect or prevent these oppression and mass killings from happening it in the first place and they come to believe that there is no god based on their negative experience they
                                    got from their life. Many of them are also get brainwashed by the evolution books written by the people who does not want to believe in God.</p>
                                <p>After getting these kinds of negative experience and on top of that you give Darwinism to study then it becomes the recipe for disaster for their life. Darwinism completely misguide people with just a stupid theory called
                                    “Evolution”. &nbsp;There are many errors in the theory proposed by Darwin and he himself has said that there are missing links in his theory such as the following. </p>
                                <p>(1) The fossil record often lacks transitional forms and that there are “explosions” of new life forms, a pattern of radiations that challenges Darwinian evolutionary theory. </p>
                                <p>(2) Many scientists have challenged the ability of random mutation and natural selection to produce complex biological features.<strong> Imaging a mouse trap coming from nowhere automatically or even a needle or a pin, would this be possible for a rational mind?</strong>                                    </p>
                                <p>(3) Many lines of evidence for Darwinian evolution and common descent are weak. Vertebrate embryos start out developing very differently, in contrast with the drawings of embryos often found in textbooks which mostly appear
                                    similar. </p>
                                <p> DNA evidence paints conflicting pictures of the “tree of life”. There is no such single “tree.” </p>
                                <p>Evidence of small-scale changes, such as the modest changes in the size of finch-beaks or slight changes in the color frequencies in the wings of “peppered moths”, shows microevolution, NOT macroevolution. </p>

                                <h2><strong>Holy Quran, the ultimate answer for the Athiest and the Darwinism</strong> </h2>
                                <p>It is only book on the face of the Earth which has the potential to deal with people afflicted with Darwinism and Atheism. It is only book which deserves a spot on every reader’s shelf. So, what is special about Holy Quran?
                                    The speciality are in the messages delivered to the Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) more than 1400 years ago by the Almighty Allah which accurately talks about modern scientific facts which just discovered few
                                    centuries ago. How could Atheist or Darwin himself could defy the verses of the Holy Quran which clearly shows the existence of Supreme Power ruling all over us. How come these verses revealed over 1400 years ago could
                                    have such accurate details of the embryological cycle which the modern science came to know recently? </p>
                                <p>It was a common belief that the world is flat and this is what Bible have taught and, going to the extent of the Earth would cause people to fall off and die and it was also a common belief that the Earth was at the center
                                    of the solar system and the moon is has its own light to rule the night as per Bible.</p>
                                <p>People alleged that Holy Quran is a copy of Bible then how come these scientific errors of Bible didn’t got onto the Holy Quran if that was the case? There are so many contradiction in Bible which you won’t find it in Quran,
                                    well in fact you won’t even find any contradictions in Holy Quran. If you go on the internet and search for the contraction in Holy Quran then you get many out of context answers on the internet which are completely
                                    misunderstood translation of Holy Quran </p>
                                <p>One such example is that the word “Ayyaam” in the verse 7:54 </p>
                                <div>
                                    <p><strong>Indeed, your Lord is Allah , who created the heavens and earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne. He covers the night with the day, [another night] chasing it rapidly; and [He created] the sun, the moon, and the stars, subjected by His command. Unquestionably, His is the creation and the command; blessed is Allah , Lord of the worlds. </strong></p>
                                </div>
                                <p>Which means either of the following </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Epoch </li>
                                    <li>Days </li>
                                    <li>Period </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Orientalist and corrupt media pick these misunderstood verses and brainwashes people against Islam. But in spite of these big propaganda by the media, Islam is still the fastest growing religion on the face of the Earth
                                    and if Musk succeed people to Mars then it will become the fastest growing religion there too. In Sha Allah. </p>
                                <p>Here comes the Scientific Miracles of Holy Quran which media will never mention. </p>
                                <h2><strong>Big Bang</strong> </h2>
                                <p> Big Bang was a theory just few decades ago but it become established scientific fact in recent decades due to technological advancement in cosmology and astronomy. Big Bang states that there was primary nebula and then
                                    there was explosion and each and every thing came into being from that secondary explosion. Holy Quran states this fact in a nutshell where it mentions in Chapter 21 and verse 30 </p>

                                <p>Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, and We separated them and made from water every living thing? Then will they not believe? </p>
                                <p>How come this is possible that the verse revealed to Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) talks about the creation of heavens and the Earth so accurately? Time to ponder for the Non Muslims. </p>
                                <p>Source <a href="http://legacy.quran.com/21/30" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://legacy.quran.com/21/30</span></a> and Dr Zakir Naik lecture about Quran and Modern Science on YouTube </p>
                                <h2><strong>All living things were created from water.</strong> </h2>
                                <p>In the Big Bang reference verse above, Allah Almighty also talks about Creation of living things from water. </p>
                                <p><strong>Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, and We separated them and made from water every living thing? Then will they not believe? </strong></p>
                                <p>I would like to remind that this verse about creation from water is way beyond Arabs comprehension even in the least. In the deserts of Arabia where there are scarcity of water who could have think about this? <strong>Today, we know that human body is made up of 70% cytoplasm which is water.</strong>                                    </p>
                                <h2><strong>Creation of the Heavens and the Earth in Six days</strong> </h2>
                                <div><img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/img/placeholder_600x400.svg" data-src="assets/img/7_54.png"></div>
                                <p><strong>Indeed, your Lord is Allah , who created the heavens and earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne. He covers the night with the day, [another night] chasing it rapidly; and [He created] the sun, the moon, and the stars, subjected by His command. Unquestionably, His is the creation and the command; blessed is Allah , Lord of all the Universes. </strong></p>
                                <p>Today, Cosmologist tells us that the universe is more than 16 billion years old. In Holy Bible, it is referred to 24 hours period of 6 days as it is on Earth but science refutes that and it cannot be possible. But in Holy
                                    Quran as it is book of Allah Almighty, it does not make such claims but instead it mention about 6 periods or 6 epoch and scientist agree with this that it can be possible with 6 epoch. </p>
                                <p>How could such modern scientific knowledge are revealed in Holy Quran which the science came to know in 20th Century? </p>
                                <h2><strong>Miraculous Iron</strong></h2>
                                <div><img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/img/placeholder_600x400.svg" alt="Holy Quran 57/25" data-src="assets/img/57_25.png"></div>
                                <p><strong>And We also sent down iron in which there lies great force and which has many uses for mankind… (Qur'an, 57:25)</strong> </p>
                                <p>Holy Quran mentions that the Iron has been sent down from Heaven and also informs the mankind that it contains numerous benefits for the human beings and other living creatures. </p>
                                <p>Not only the iron on earth, but also the iron in the entire Solar System, comes from outer space, since the temperature in the Sun is inadequate for the formation of iron. The sun has a surface temperature of 6,000 degrees
                                    Celsius, and a core temperature of approximately 20 million degrees. Iron can only be produced in much larger stars than the Sun, where the temperature reaches a few hundred million degrees. When the amount of iron
                                    exceeds a certain level in a star, the star can no longer accommodate it, and it eventually explodes in what is called a "nova" or a "supernova." </p>

                                <div><img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/img/placeholder_600x400.svg" alt="Holy Quran 57/25" data-src="assets/img/13_3.png"></div>
                                <p>And it is He who spread the earth and placed therein firmly set mountains and rivers; and from all of the fruits<strong> He made therein two mates;</strong> He causes the night to cover the day. Indeed in that are signs
                                    for a people who give thought.Holy Quran 13:3</p>
                                <p>Who could have thought that plants have got sexes in the middle of the madness of the Arabian desert? We came to know about this recently and how come Holy Quran mention about this 1400 years ago so accurately? Time to
                                    ponder and reflect. </p>
                                <h2><strong>Bird and animals live in communities</strong> </h2>

                                <p>And there is no creature on [or within] the earth or bird that flies with its wings except [that they are] communities like you. We have not neglected in the Register a thing. Then unto their Lord they will be gathered.
                                    </p>

                                <p>This is Holy Quran, the Book of the Lord of the Worlds, Allah Almighty, the Most Powerful. Human beings taught that they only live in community for many centuries but didn’t know even the cats and dogs and other animals
                                    also live in communities like us. </p>

                                <div><img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/img/placeholder_600x400.svg" alt="Holy Quran 57/25" data-src="assets/img/16_68.png"></div>
                                <p>And your Lord inspired to the bee, "Take for yourself among the mountains, houses, and among the trees and [in] that which they construct. </p>
                                <div><img class="img-responsive img-center" src="assets/img/placeholder_600x400.svg" alt="Holy Quran 57/25" data-src="assets/img/16_69.png"></div>
                                <p>Then eat from all the fruits and follow the ways of your Lord laid down [for you]." There emerges from their bellies a drink, varying in colors, in which there is healing for people. Indeed in that is a sign for a people
                                    who give thought.16:68-69 </p>
                                <h2><strong>Life style of the Spider</strong> </h2>

                                <p>The example of those who take allies other than Allah is like that of the spider who takes a home. And indeed, the weakest of homes is the home of the spider, if they only knew. Holy Quran 29:41</p>
                                <p>Today science confirms that male spider after having sexual intercourse runs away from the own home it constructed eventually end up eating up alive by the female spider. Who could have known about this 1400 years ago which
                                    the modern science discovered today? Indeed Allah and his messengers spoken the truth and we came to know in what terms the spider home where the weakest? Beside looking flimsy with our naked eye. </p>

                                <p>People of the Scripture Jews and Christian used to make fun of Holy Quran and mock Muslims that how could Ants communicate? Today, Modern science tells us that Ant have complex communication system </p>
                                <p>Scientific research into ants has revealed that these tiny animals have very organised social lives and that, as a requirement of that organisation, they also have a very complex communication network. For example, <em>National Geographic </em>reports
                                    that: </p>
                                <p>Huge and tiny, an ant carries in her head multiple sensory organs to pick up chemical and visual signals vital to colonies that may contain a million or more workers, all of which are female. The brain contains half a million
                                    nerve cells; eyes are compound; antennae act as nose and fingertips. Projections below the mouth sense taste; hairs respond to touch </p>
                                <p>Even if we are not aware of it, ants use a variety of methods to communicate, thanks to their very sensitive sensory organs. They use these organs at all times, from finding prey to following one another, and from building
                                    their nests to waging war. With 500,000 nerve cells squeezed into their 2-3 mm bodies, they possess a communications system that astonishes human beings. </p>
                                <p>How come Holy Quran knows about this scientific fact which scientist discovered in 20th century? </p>

                                    to rule the night. </p>
                                <p>If Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) copied it then how come he missed this? Indeed Holy Quran and the Bible have similarities because they are coming from the same source, the Almighty Allah. But the issue with Bible
                                    is that it got corrupted over time and it is revealed only for the Children of Israel and not as a revelation for the whole of Mankind. </p>

                                <p><strong>After that He smoothed out the earth. (Qur'an, 79:30)</strong> </p>
                                <p>In the above verse, the word "<em>daha</em>" is used in the original Arabic. It, translated as "smoothed out," comes from the word "<em>dahv</em>," meaning "to spread." Although the word "<em>dahv</em>" also means to cover
                                    or to set out, the meaning of the verb is more than just a prosaic setting out, since it describes setting out in a circle. </p>
                                <p>The concept of roundness is also present in other words derived from "<em>dahv</em>." For example, the word "<em>dahv</em>" also refers to children dropping a ball into a hole in the ground, games involving throwing stones
                                    into holes and games played with walnuts. Words derived from that root are also used for an ostrich making a nest, cleaning stones from where it is about to lie down, the place where it lays its eggs and the egg itself.
                                    </p>
                                <p>Indeed, the Earth is round, in a manner reminiscent of an egg. The slightly flattened spherical shape of the Earth is known as geoid. From that point of view, the use of the word "<em>daha</em>" contains important information
                                    about the shape that Allah has given to the Earth. For hundreds of years, people imagined the Earth to be completely flat and only learned the truth thanks to technology. Yet, this fact was revealed in the Qur'an fourteen
                                    centuries ago. </p>
                                <h2><strong>Conclusion</strong> </h2>
                                <p>Holy Quran is the only book on the face of the Earth when read with unbiased mindset will surely guide the sincere people who are seriously searching for the truth. How could Atheist and Darwin followers could refute the

                            people get brainwashed by this same media as they don’t perform their due diligence especially regarding Islam and Muslim. </p><a class="btn btn-default active btn-block" role="button" href="https://thetruthengineland.com/whitenationalist-terrorism-media-underreporting/">LEARN MORE HERE.......</a></div>
