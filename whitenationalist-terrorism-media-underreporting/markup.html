                            <p>Media is one of the most corrupt entities on the face of the Earth. It has the power to make the white into black and black into white, from hero to zero and from zero to hero. It can do all these things thanks to the ignorant
                                people who are subscribed to their channels and who does not bother to cross check the information given by the media. They are just ready to consume whatever lies media has to throw at them. Unfortunately, even the educated
                                people get brainwashed by this same media as they don’t perform their due diligence especially regarding Islam and Muslim. </p>
                            <h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Media Hypocrisy</span></strong></h3>
                            <div class="svg-container"><img class="img-responsive svg-image-layout" src="assets/img/loading_throbber-128.png" data-src="/whitenationalist-terrorism-media-underreporting/assets/img/newspaper-154444.svg"></div>
                            <p>Many times media does not report terrorism or murder committed by the Non Muslims i.e., Christians, Jews, &nbsp;Hindus, Sikh or White supremacist and they underreport them by just running a marquee across their channel and
                                does not get highlighted in the headlines. </p>
                            <p>They are only there to highlight terrorism committed by Muslims so that they can create fear in the minds of the people which are good for the politicians and evil corporation(who run the 95% media biz) who can justify so called
                                “War on Terrorism”. </p>
                            <p>Invading countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen etc., so that they loot resources such as Afghanistan,Oil(Iraq) and Gas(Syria), in order to tackle the U.S debt time bomb ticking over their head. </p>
                            <p>President Donald Trump was right when he mentioned that media underreport terrorism committed. But at the same time he was wrong that media under report terrorism committed by Muslims. Well, in fact, it is the other way around.
                                </p>
                            <h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reseach found Biased reporting</span></strong></h3>

                            <p>According to one study <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world-0/terror-attacks-media-coverage-muslim-islamist-white-racism-islamophobia-study-georgia-state-a7820726.html" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">here</span></a>,
                                if a Muslim commits a murder or terrorism then it gets 400% more media coverage. But it is not the case with the Christian or Jew. Why is this double standard? The so called vanguard of freedom of speech? Study also find
                                that the Muslim committed just 12.4 percent of attacks between the period 2011 and 2015 but received 41.4 percent of media coverage. </p>
                            <p>These kinds of things make Americans scary and fearful of the term “radical Islamic terrorism” as concocted by the media and such fear are baseless. Who suffers because of this corrupt media? The innocent Muslims all over the
                                world who are facing backlash due to Islamophobia created by media to benefit their masters for the war game. </p>

                            <p>US scientist studied the U.S paper media coverage and counted all the terrorist act happened in the U.S soil and they found out that the Boston Marathon bomber who killed 3 people received <strong>20 percent of all media coverage across the news channel for the period 2011 and 2015</strong>.
                                </p>
                            <p>Contrary to this, the terrorist attack which took place in the year 2012 in <strong>Wisconsin at Sikh temple left 6 people dead</strong> and it was done by <strong>Wade Michael Page, a white supremacist</strong>, <strong>received just 3.8 percent of all the media coverage.

                <h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">White Supremacist Terrorism is a Bigger Threat to United States</span></strong></h3>
                <p>According to the report by The Nation Institute’s Investigative Fund and the Center for Investigative Reporting’s Reveal found that there are<strong> almost twice as many terrorist incidents committed by the white supremacist</strong>                    as compared to Islamist extremists for the period between 2008 and 2016 in U.S.A. </p>
                <div class="svg-container"><img class="img-responsive svg-image-layout" src="assets/img/loading_throbber-128.png" data-src="/whitenationalist-terrorism-media-underreporting/assets/img/donald-trump-2030308.svg"></div>
                <p>President Donald Trump is silent in spite of these white terrorist attacks. Because he had been brainwashed by the so called “Fake News” and does not count any murder as terrorism unless if it is committed by the Muslim. The research also
                    found out that there are <strong>201 terrorist incidents took place in U.S for the period 2008 and 2016</strong> and <strong>115 cases was committed by the white supremacis</strong>t ranging from militias to “sovereign citizens” as
                    compared to <strong>63 cases by so called “Islamist extremist” </strong></p>
                <p>Clearly, Media is biased against Muslims and Islam and they only interested to highlight the murder and terror cases when committed by Muslims otherwise they tend to hide from the people as much as they can to conceal the truth from the
                    general public, as it is the case with white supremacist. By doing this, media becomes a clear supporter of white supremacist group. </p>
                <h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No concrete action against White supremacist yet</span></strong></h3>
                <p>President Donald Trump does not took any action against these white supremacist group to stop such attacks in the future but always ready to take action against so called “Islamist extremist” when the statistics show far right terrorism
                    is more dangerous than the so called “Islamist extremism”. </p>
                <p>It is because of this media attitude we are seeing the rise of Islamophobia which creates unnecessary violence between Muslims and Non Muslims communities who otherwise would love to share neighbourhood with love and harmony and peace.
                    If we left these radicalization of white supremacist unchecked then we have more trouble in the future as they are getting little attention from the media on purpose and almost no action from the politicians and law enforcement department.

            </div>
            <p>Muslims in Myanmar's Rakhine state are suffering from worst human crisis. They are being killed and massacre by Buddhist terrorist who are led by their Buddhist Monk leaders who instigate and plan for systematic ethnic cleansing of Muslims
                from their land. Muslims are living their for hunderds of year but still denied citizenship and moreover they are state sponsored for the ethic cleansing of the Muslims. Muslim women are gang raped by these Buddhist monk followers or soldiers
                and thousands of Muslim men had been burnt alive. Former U.S President Barack Obama visted the country during these killings but does not do anything to stop this crime. Why? Because U.S ecomomy is getting a boost from trading from Myanmar
                so he doesn't care about Muslim massacre. But wait a second but he send thousands of troops to Syria to protect Syrians. Correct? Actually, if it benefits U.S then they will send troops otherwise they are least bother as in the case of
                Myanmar and Central African Region. Coming back to our context, does Media reported such events to the Western Audience? Fox News? CNN, MSNBC,CBS,BBC,Washington Post? It shows how media is deceiving Western audience is showing Muslims
                are the only terrorist and there is no body beside Muslim does anything of terrorism. <a href="https://www.thetruthengineland.com/allmuslimsarenotterrorist/" target="_blank">More here</a></p>

            <p>Hope the general public is aware of such white supremacist incidents and the statistics presented here appeal to any rational person and people realize that white supremacist terrorism is indeed a problem and more dangerous than the Islamic
                extremist. They both needed to be suppressed at the root level and media should stop using the term "radical Islam" to indicate Muslim black sheep as Islam has nothing to do with it.<a href="https://www.thetruthengineland.com/islamagainstterrorism/"
                target="_blank">See this</a>. If they are just then they should also use "Christian radical" or "Jewish Radical" to indicate Christian or Jew black sheep for fair reporting.</p>
