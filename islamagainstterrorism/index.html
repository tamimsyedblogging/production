Myth or Reality?</h1></div></div></div></div><div class=row><div class=col-md-12><div><p>Since 9/11, Media is aggressively blaming Islam and Muslims for the evil doing of so called Muslim. Having said that, they are solely responsible for the rise of Islamophobia across the globe. Coming back to the topic. The name “Islam” itself means “Peace”. The definition of Islam is “Peace acquired by submitting your will to Almighty Allah”. &nbsp; Holy Quran clearly states “Whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land – it is as if he had slain mankind entirely.And whoever saves one – it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. Holy Quran 5:32”</p><p>The verse is enough to justify that Islam promotes peace and harmony and does not support terrorism even in the least. But one might question(as the media brainwashed), hey wait a second, doesn’t it contains verses of fighting and killing? Surely it does, but those verses are quoted out of context by the media. The most popular verse they cherry pick from the Holy Quran is the verse of Surah At Tawba 9:5 and 9:7.</p><h1><strong>Brainwashing out of context verse # 1</strong></h1><p>And when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, let them [go] on their way. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. Quran</p><h1><strong>Brainwashing out of context verse # 2</strong></h1><p>How can there be for the polytheists a treaty in the sight of Allah and with His Messenger, except for those with whom you made a treaty at al-Masjid al-Haram? So as long as they are upright toward you, be upright toward them. Indeed, Allah loves the righteous who fear Him Quran</p><h1><strong>Background of the above verses.</strong></h1><p>Those verses were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) in the battlefield. Surah At Tawba starts when there was a treaty between the Polytheist of Mecca and the Muslims, by the time the verse 4 was revealed the treaty was unilaterally broken by the Polytheist of Mecca.</p><p>To boost the moral of the Muslim army, Allah reveal these verses to stand up and defend against the disbelievers. Any Army General of the military would do the same even in this modern time and won’t tell the army to get killed when the enemies come to kill them because they wanted peace and harmony.</p><p>By the way, the media group immediately goes to the verse 5 by skipping verse 4. Do you know why? Because it has solution for their problem. The verse 4 says “And if any one of the polytheists <strong>seeks your protection, then grant him protection</strong> so that he may hear the words of Allah . Then deliver them to the place of safety. That is because they are a people who do not know.”</p><p>Which Army General in the modern world or in the ancient world would give such instructions? Holy Quran is telling “give them protection to Polytheist” such is the stand of Islam and the Muslims against people who does not believe in Islam(contrary to what Media says about Muslim thrashing Non Muslim) and our Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him).</p><p>The maximum the Army General would do is let them go free, but here Allah Almighty is telling in the Holy Quran to take them to the place of security. &nbsp;Remember, leaving people in the battlefield is easy to do but taking people to the place of security and that too when they are from the enemy side is way beyond human comprehension.</p><p>There are other verses in the Holy Quran where they cherry pick verses to suit their taste so that they can brainwash people. Doing so generates profit for the elite politicians and the businessmen running the media corporations who could justify invasion of Iraq(for oil), Afghanistan(for Lithium) and destabilization of Middle East(pounding Syria for <a href=https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-United-States-deem-it-okay-to-intervene-in-the-political-affairs-of-other-countries-using-warfare><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gas line</span></a>) by their Greater Israel plot allies such as Israel and ISIS(Israeli Secret Intelligence Services)</p><p>But you know media won’t talk about terrorist groups like Lord Salvation Army(Christian terrorist group in Uganda),Maoist(INDIA),LTTE(Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka),United Liberation Front of Assam,KKK(Ku Klux Klan in United States) and many more.

No. Indeed.</strong>Media talks about Islam is this and Islam is that. But do you know what are the rules of war in Islam? Here is the rules of war in Islam as dictated by the Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him)</p><div class=img-center><img class="img-responsive img-center" src=assets/img/GgLt4f1.jpg></div><ul><li>Don’t cut tree (Islam inform that even plant have got a life even 1400 years ago)</li><li>Don’t kill a child</li><li>Don’t kill old people</li><li>Don’t destroy a temple or a church.(ISIS? Or Israel Secret Intelligence Services.You Decide)</li><li>Don’t destroy a building</li><li>Don’t kill those who surrender</li><li>Don’t kill who ran away from the battlefield.</li><li>Don’t kill a woman</li><li>Don’t kill a sick person</li><li>Don’t kill a monk or a priest</li><li>Don’t disfigure the dead.</li><li>Don’t kill the animal except for eating</li><li>Be good to the prisoners and feed them</li><li>Don’t enforce Islam.</li></ul><p>This is the stand of Islam and the Muslims and the Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him), the leader of whole mankind. Holy Quran says that he has been sent as a mercy to the whole of worlds and the universes. Media won’t even mention about this information to the general public because they want to create Islamophobe on purpose. But they do not know the plan of Allah. Allah says in the Holy Quran that “They too plot and plan but Allah too plan and plot, but Allah is the Best of Planner.”</p><p>For more information on the topic, please watch this YouTube video.</p><div class=video-center><iframe width=560 height=315 allowfullscreen="" frameborder=0 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/l2MBgK79eLw class=video-center></iframe></div><p>How can Islam which even promotes justice even in the field of battle could ever be associated with heinous things like terrorism or extremism? I would leave the readers to think for themselves and recommend them to stop consuming media and its lies.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer><div class=footer-center><div class=sharethis-inline-share-buttons style=background-color:#f8f5f0;width:100%></div></div><div class=footer-center><div class=row style=background-color:#f8f5f0;width:100%><div class=col-md-12><link href=//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/horizontal-slim-10_7.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css><style type=text/css>
