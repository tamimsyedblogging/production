                                    <p>ISIS call themselves as establishing the Islamic caliphate to lead the Muslim world against evil Western powers, but end up killing Muslims men, women and children mercilessly. Does that make any sense? You kill and
                                        massacre the followers themselves? It is like telling that CEO of Facebook wants to create social media by killing people? Make sense? Nay! </p>
                                    <p>If followers are killed in millions on a per year basis then what would remain? If ISIS was indeed was for Muslims caliphate then they would have stopped long before, as they could see millions getting killed right
                                        in front of their eyes. They also mainly targets Muslim priest or Imam, so that right Islamic teachings does not reach to the young generation, which help them to brainwash people to achieve their political means.
                                        Even the worst of Muslims have great respect for the Imam of the Masjid. </p>

                                    <p>Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) informed us about such group of criminals who would cause more trouble than anyone else and they are the one who would join the army of Dajjal at the end of time. Prophet Muhammad
                                        (Peace be upon him) </p>
                                    <p>At the end of time (meaning: the last days of the world), there will appear some people among you who are young in age, immature and senseless; they will use the best of the speech of the people in their claims, and
                                        they will leave Islam just as the arrow pierces the body of the game and then abandons it. (Bukhari) </p>
                                    <p>The Prophet said: They recite the Quran but it does not go past their throats, meaning that the teachings of the Quran do not enter their hearts, nor do they understand or comprehend them. </p>
                                    <p>They quote the Quran and Hadith to their perverted purposes.They insult and defame Muslim leaders, declaring them to be misguided. Their [ideological] ancestor was a man [Dhu Al-Khuwaisirah] who said to the Messenger
                                        of Allah as he was distributing war booty: “O Muhammed, be just (in your distribution) I do not see you acting justly.” </p>
                                    <p>The Messenger of Allah replied: “Woe to you! Who is just if I am not just?” Enraged by Dhu Al-Khuwaisirah’s insolence, ‘Umar said: “O Messenger of Allah, allow me to kill him!” But the Messenger of Allah did not permit
                                        ‘Omar to do so and said: You will slight your prayers and fasting in comparison to their prayers and fasting; and they will go to the extreme in the religion until they abandon it altogether. </p>
                                    <p>They appear in times of disunity and strife (mentioned in a hadith reported by Bukhari and Muslim). .The Khawarij do not hold the scholars and people of knowledge in high esteem if their opinions do not conform with
                                        theirs.They mercilessly kill Muslims if they go against their way or ideology and <strong>they don’t even spare a pregnant woman.</strong> </p>

                                    <p>Mainstream media is discussing about Saudi Arabia,Qatar involvement in providing cash to the ISIS. Seriously? Media? It would be better suited if you guys could have said it is Israel behind the creation of ISIS and

                                    <p>Mainstream media manufacture the story of Syria in such a way that it shows that a war is going on in Syria by its Premier on its own people and United States should do something about it. By forming this stories day
                                        and night, it is trying for justification for war with Syria. But the war will come at a price and it would be from American soldier lives and citizens tax paying money. Actually going into war would help, just
                                        the private industry and the politicians as they could reduce the debt burden which is getting piled on since the inception and banking interest crap as well as credit card deception. Showing to the world that they
                                        are going to war with Syria in order to establish democracy there but in reality they do the opposite of it. They end up killing millions of innocent people and displacing them by relentless bombing in and out of
                                        their nation. We are seeing this as pattern since the Gulf War and continued the same with Afghanistan and Iraq and now with Libya, Yemen and Syria. </p>
                                    <p>In the year 2000,Robert F Kennedy <a href="http://www.ecowatch.com/syria-another-pipeline-war-1882180532.html?page=4" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">reported</span></a> Qatar proposed a gas
                                        pipeline which would traverse from Qatar, Jordan,Saudi Arabia, Syria,Turkey into Europe as they will get hooked onto the world’s natural gas repository and also they will have cheaper access. But Russia sells almost
                                        70% of the gas to Europe and Qatar pipeline would put Russia out of business in the near future. Moreover, Syria’s premier Basshar does not want to go with Qatar proposed pipeline and endorsed Russian pipeline which
                                        would go from Syrian through Iran and in some ports in Lebanon. </p>
                                    <p>Therefor, Syria rejected this in the year 2009 and Qatar planned for the Sunni uprising in Syria to overthrow its Premier. Israel was also hell bent on derailing the Russian proposed pipeline to Iran so Israel and US
                                        joined the game and planned for the CIA coup and it is all orchestrated in the Spring 2011. It was shown how the small people protesting and demonstrating against Bashar Al Assad and made it formed into full blown
                                        civil war in Syria with the help of Syrian rebels trained by CIA as well as pulling in ISIS from Iraq to bulldozed Syrian in and out. </p>
